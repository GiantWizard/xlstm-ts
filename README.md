This repository contains the implementation of the **xLSTM-TS model**, a time series-optimised adaptation of the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture proposed by Beck et al. (2024). The xLSTM-TS model modifies the xLSTM framework to make it suitable for time series forecasting. The architecture includes the xLSTM-TS implementation and integrates wavelet denoising techniques to enhance forecasting accuracy. While designed for versatility in time series forecasting, the model has been applied to short-term Stock Market Trend Prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in financial applications as a key use case.

In addition to xLSTM-TS, this repository features implementations of several state-of-the-art forecasting models for benchmarking purposes, such as TCN, N-BEATS, TFT, N-HiTS, and TiDE. These models have been evaluated alongside xLSTM-TS in our study. This repository provides datasets and code for the complete workflow, from preprocessing, to model training, and evaluation, along with detailed comparisons of accuracy and trend prediction capabilities.

## üìÑ Abstract

The stock market is a fundamental component of financial systems, reflecting economic health, providing investment opportunities, and influencing global dynamics. Accurate stock market predictions can lead to significant gains and promote better investment decisions. However, predicting stock market trends is challenging due to their non-linear and stochastic nature.

This study investigates the efficacy of advanced deep learning models for short-term trend forecasting using daily and hourly closing prices from the S&P 500 index and the Brazilian ETF EWZ. The models explored include Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series Forecasting (N-BEATS), Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting (N-HiTS), and Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE). Furthermore, we introduce the Extended Long Short-Term Memory for Time Series (xLSTM-TS) model, an xLSTM adaptation optimised for time series prediction.

Wavelet denoising techniques were applied to smooth the signal and reduce minor fluctuations, providing cleaner data as input for all approaches. Denoising significantly improved performance in predicting stock price direction. Among the models tested, xLSTM-TS consistently outperformed others. For example, it achieved a test accuracy of 72.82% and an F1 score of 73.16% on the EWZ daily dataset.

By leveraging advanced deep learning models and effective data preprocessing techniques, this research provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning for market movement forecasting, highlighting both the potential and the challenges involved.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the environment and run the code, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the experiments.

## üìä Dataset

The datasets used in this study include daily and hourly data for two indices: the S&P 500 and the Brazilian ETF EWZ. These were sourced from the Yahoo Finance and Tiingo APIs, with data spanning the following periods:

- **EWZ Daily**: 14/07/2000 - 29/12/2023
- **S&P 500 Daily**: 03/01/2000 - 29/12/2023
- **EWZ Hourly**: 13/07/2020 - 11/07/2024
- **S&P 500 Hourly**: 13/07/2020 - 11/07/2024

The data fields include Date, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, with the **Close** price serving as the target variable for trend prediction.

## üîß Preprocessing

### üåÄ Noise Reduction

To improve model accuracy, we used **wavelet denoising** to remove noise from the time series data. This approach, based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), effectively reduced minor fluctuations, providing a clearer signal for model training.

### üìê Data Splitting

Each dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets to enable robust model evaluation:

- **Daily Data**: Training (86%), Validation (7%), Test (7%)
- **Hourly Data**: Training (75%), Validation (12.5%), Test (12.5%)

## üß† Models

The focus of this repository is the xLSTM-TS model, an adaptation of the **Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM)** architecture, as proposed by Beck et al. (2024), specifically designed for time series applications. To benchmark its performance, we also implemented several well-regarded deep learning models for time series forecasting using the Darts library:

1. **xLSTM-TS (Extended LSTM for Time Series)** - Our proposed model that adapts the xLSTM architecture for time series forecasting.
2. **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** - Uses causal convolutions for capturing temporal dependencies.
3. **Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series Forecasting (N-BEATS)** - Employs residual connections to capture both short- and long-term trends in time series data.
4. **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** - Integrates attention mechanisms for interpretability in multi-horizon forecasting.
5. **Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series Forecasting (N-HiTS)** - A hierarchical approach optimised for long-horizon forecasts.
6. **Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE)** - Combines dense encoders with MLPs for efficient predictive modelling.

## üìà Results

### üìä Performance Metrics

The models were evaluated using several metrics, including Accuracy, F1 Score, MAE, RMSE, RMSSE, and MASE. The xLSTM-TS model consistently outperformed other models, demonstrating robust predictive power across both daily and hourly datasets. Below are some highlights:

- **EWZ Daily**: xLSTM-TS achieved a Test Accuracy of 72.87% and an F1 Score of 73.16%.
- **S&P 500 Daily**: xLSTM-TS achieved a Test Accuracy of 71.28% and an F1 Score of 73.00%.

These results show that xLSTM-TS is especially effective in capturing stock market trends when paired with wavelet-based denoising.

### üóùÔ∏è Key Findings

- **Wavelet Denoising**: This preprocessing technique greatly enhanced prediction accuracy by providing a clearer input signal.
- **Model Performance**: xLSTM-TS showed superior performance across datasets, especially when compared with other state-of-the-art models.
- **Timeframe Sensitivity**: Predictions of daily trends generally achieved higher accuracy than hourly trends, likely due to the higher volatility in shorter time frames.
